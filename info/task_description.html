<pre>
     There are 100 coins, 99 of which are identical. 
     There might be one that is different, it is not known whether it is heavier or lighter than the others.       
     This time the balance may be used 5 times to determine if there is a unique coin;  
     If there is, to isolate it and determine its weight relative to the others.
</pre>

<p style="text-align: center;">
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A balance (which is a coroutine(generator) that return the result of balance.)    
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work with the balance: </strong> <pre>Send a tuple of two sets of integers to the coroutine, then the coroutine will yield -1 if the  coins with indices in first set is heavier.
    yield 1 if  the coins with indices in second set is heavier. yield 0 if two sets of coins have weigh the same.
    The balance can only work for 5 times.
    The indices of coins are from 1 to 100.      
    </pre>      
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int
    <pre>
     If all 1000 coins are identical, the output is 0.
     Otherwise, suppose the index of the different coin is i.
     return i if i is heavier.
     return -i if i is lighter.
